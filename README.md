# Isaac Smith's Personal Website
This is a repository to store my personal website, a Vue.JS project making use of modularity and dynamic data in order to allow me to change components and information on this page easily as I get further and furher along in my career. Also, I like making things harder than they need to be, it seems!

This project is a SPA (Singla Page Application) that acts as a sort of digital resume, allowing me to play with the display a little more, show of my developer flair, as well as play with adding more information and real links to projects and other work.

If you have any additions (though I can't imagine who would want to add anything to *my* website!) don't hesitate to open a PR, or an issue if you'd prefer! I absolutely love criticism and any commentary is much appreciated.
